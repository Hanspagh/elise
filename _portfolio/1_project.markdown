In Belgium, the area around the city of Charleroi bears the marks of a prosperous period. Transport routes, traffic lanes, waterway lines, railways, suburban spreads, vast industrial areas and spoil tips are important remnants of this time. Today, though, it suffers the resulting congestion of all these elements.
<br/>
<br/>

The work shown here has its sources in an analytical reading of this region. 

<br/>
In the first phase, the work comes from an observation of Charleroi and its territory as a true landscape where we want to observe and understand its characteristics and uniqueness. It attempts to take a fresh look at places that are in transition, such as abandoned spaces or undefined areas, or those without function like brownfields.

<br/>
<br/>
The second phase presents a drawing for a project. It endeavours to focus on a unique quality and its potential to provide an alternative form of the space.

	The different types of transportation networks were developed at the same time as Charleroi’s growth. Today, they are a part of the city’s structure, despite the economic decline that has plagued this area over the past few years. They became anchored over time in the urban fabric by the inevitable connecting roads. Parts of this infrastructure were very developed, others less so and others became obsolete. Some highways stretched and spread while some railways closed. Due to these huge infrastructures, pedestrians have difficulty finding their place. The consequences of this situation are as follows: firstly, the maintenance is expensive for public authorities and secondly, Charleroi’s residents are obliged to use their cars frequently. This assessment considers alternatives solutions--for example, utilizing non-motorized forms of transport.

	For the project of rehabilitation of the old vicinal and old towing paths, we have to multiply possible actions: creating new connections, bisections, finding a way to highlight areas with construction or adjusting of access, public buildings, housing, ect. The map nearby shows the Vicinal with some new connections and ramifications, but as architects, we focus on architectural way to work with more details. The idea is to highlight the Vicinal with some construction spread along this tiny thread on strategic points to bring it to life. We measure different area where  public and collective buildings can be drawn.
	<br/>
	For that, we did a detailed investigation in the field alongside it. What emerge are two main interesting characteristics which can become good starting points for projects. 
	<br/>
	The first one is the topography: there is a natural topography with the valley of the Sambre river and human topography with spoil tips and railway ( unable to use steep slopes, they made a path: sometimes they dig and sometimes they make little hill for the path). The second one is the scenary / landscape. Notably, along the paths there is heavy vegetation. Because of the topography, we have a lot of great clear-open view on the greater scenary.

		The project aims to bring back the vicinal’s role and value in the area. In the past, it was a railway but now it is just a fractured and forgotten pedestrian way in the back of plots. Architectural drawings for the project are shown here.

 

	_ A territory attribute

	The idea is to link two scales. The building, here, is creating a filter, like a threshold between the tiny line of the vicinal and the surface’s landscape. The plan with series of perpendicular walls allows an interplay between the opening and closing views between this two scales. The resulting special display works to kindle pedestrians’ interest for the landscape. By walking or biking along the pathway, commuters could enjoy a balance between speed, distance and position to catch framings of landscape.

	In fact, when walking along the vicinal, it is possible to see the landscape through the buildings well only when looking on a line parallel with the wall. From inside, the wall’s series highlights the depths of the project. Light and shadows enrich the perspective. 

 

	_ The work’s edges

	The plot has hills and the vicinal way is pre-existent. Hooks between the vicinal and ground floor of the building are dynamic: different distances, heights and materials. The links are not uniform and not monotonous. Some of the links are limited while others connect. The different elements interact to create an interesting, vibrant pathway.

	In the project, all houses are double-oriented flats (there is an opening running through the building) This situation anabled a clear and open view on the landscape in one side and access to the balcony on the orther side. On the access balcony, walls are pierced, so that each of the remaining walls frame alcoves. This creates distance with the shared space and owners of flat can appropriate them.
